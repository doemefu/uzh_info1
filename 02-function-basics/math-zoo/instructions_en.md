Implement a function `zoo` which takes a single number `number` as the only parameter.

The function should return a tuple containing the following six values:
 * `number` rounded down to the nearest integer
 * `number` rounded up to the nearest integer
 * the arc tangent of `number`, in radians
 * a tuple containing the fractional and integer parts of `number`
 * the next floating-point value after `number` towards minus infinity
 * the cube root of `number`

To solve this task, you will need to search the `math` [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) for the necessary functions.
