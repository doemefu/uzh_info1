In mathematics, the factorial `n!` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`:

    n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1

Write a function `fac` that takes an integer as input and returns its factorial. For example, `fac(5)` is `120`, `fac(0)` is defined as `1`. You do not have to handle any negative numbers.
